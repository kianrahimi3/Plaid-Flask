This app uses the API provided by Plaid to create a personal finance app. The program utilizes Python Flask to create a simple app that can connect to the bank, show basic account information, and see the transactions made. The app currently only runs on Plaid's "Sandbox" mode, for anything past this requires paying for the tool.
